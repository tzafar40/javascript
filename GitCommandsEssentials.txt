Important Options
-m <message>
Sets the commit's message. Make sure to provide a concise description that helps your teammates (and yourself) understand what happened.

-a
Includes all currently changed files in this commit. Keep in mind, however, that untracked (new) files are not included.

--amend
Rewrites the very last commit with any currently staged changes and/or a new commit message. Git will rewrite the last commit and effectively replace it with the amended one. Note that such a rewriting of commits should only be performed on commits that have not been pushed to a remote repository, yet.
